**3. Simulation of Electronic Spectra of Molecules**

We simulate the electronic spectra of a series of dienes using
density functional theoretical (DFT) models. The vertical excitation energies are calculated using the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) method for the
minimum energy geometries of the molecules in their ground electronic state.
