**2. Simulated Vibrational, Rovibrational and Rotational Raman Spectra**

We generate a simulated rovibrational and rotational Raman spectrum of a few diatomic molecules using spreadsheet or a computer pro-
gram. We use the rigid-rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations in gen-
erating the spectra. In addition, we also simulate the vibrational spectrum
of protonated water dimer using ab initio methods.
